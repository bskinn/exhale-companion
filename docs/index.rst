Exhale Companion
==============================================

Welcome to the companion website for `exhale <http://exhale.rtfd.io/>`_.  The purpose of
this website is to give a simple example of what your Library API could look like if you
follow the `start to finish directions <http://exhale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#start-to-finish-for-read-the-docs>`_
to get things hosted on RTD using the `treeView` options.

.. warning::
   Exhale is currently being debugged!  There are known problems with

   1. Templates: full and partial template specialization currently have to be ignored,
      but this should not be the case.
   2. Exhale relies on the ``programlisting`` in the XML documents generated by Doxygen
      in order to generate some of the ownership links (e.g. the file that a function
      was defined in).

   This means that what you see for the generated API on this page is significantly
   different in some places, since I'm inspecting the differences between local and
   remote XML generation etc.

   For a fully functioning (including how to skip over template specializations) library
   API being generated, please refer to the `NanoGUI documentation <http://nanogui.rtfd.io>`_.
